This repo contains codes for Naive Bayes algorithm in machine learning


### Logistic regression in Machine learning  
 Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes' Theorem.  
 It  is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.  
 It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.  
 
 There are three types of Naive Bayes model under the scikit-learn library:  
 * Multinomial: It is used for discrete counts.  
 * Gaussian: It is used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.  
 * Bernoulli: It is based on the Bernoulli Distribution and accepts only binary values i.e. 0 or 1. Useful if your feature vectors are binary (i.e. zeros and ones).
